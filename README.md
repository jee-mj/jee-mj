# Hello, World!

### I'm the captain of THIS ship (my repos, my rules). ðŸš¢

## Welcome

Please excuse the lack of professionalism that may appear this repository. I never started coding all serious like in an enterprise environment. I started coding by reverse engineering games because otherwise I wasn't allowed to play video games.
